                National parks are areas of protected land designated by the government to conserve and preserve natural and cultural resources for future generations. The concept of national parks originated in the United States in the mid-19th century, when concerns about the impact of human activity on natural environments began to arise. The establishment of Yellowstone National Park in 1872 as the world's first national park marked the beginning of the modern national park system. The creation of national parks in the United States was part of a larger movement to protect natural areas, which also included the establishment of national forests and wildlife refuges.

                Since the establishment of Yellowstone National Park, the national park system has grown to include more than 400 parks and monuments across the United States. The National Park Service, which oversees the management of these areas, was created in 1916 to ensure the protection and preservation of these lands for future generations. Today, national parks serve as important educational and recreational resources, providing opportunities for visitors to explore and learn about the natural and cultural history of the United States. The national park system continues to evolve and expand, with new parks and monuments designated each year to protect and celebrate the country's unique landscapes and cultural heritage.
