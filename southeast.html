This region includes parks such as the Great Smoky Mountains, the Everglades, and the Shenandoah, each with its own unique landscapes, wildlife, and cultural history. The Great Smoky Mountains, straddling the border between North Carolina and Tennessee, is the most visited national park in the country, with over 11 million visitors each year. The Everglades, located in southern Florida, is the largest subtropical wilderness in the country, home to an incredible diversity of plant and animal species, including the endangered Florida panther. The Shenandoah, located in Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains, offers visitors stunning views of the surrounding landscape and a chance to explore the region's rich history, including the stories of the Native American tribes who once lived there and the struggles of early settlers to survive in the rugged wilderness. Together, these parks showcase the natural beauty and cultural richness of the Southeast and offer visitors a chance to connect with this unique region.</p>
